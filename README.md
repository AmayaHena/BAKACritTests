# CritTests

![](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/bf/f0/d4/bff0d4921329499981eed72d2100334f.jpg)

A stupid way to use Criterion for any language (since you can execute a binary!).

Since I wanted to use some tests for my school, using criterion for coverage, I use it in a stupid way :p

There is only example and some explanation (it's pretty simple and basic).

(The examples are based on Haskell.)
